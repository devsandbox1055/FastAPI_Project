<h1>FastAPI Full Stack Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This repository contains a full stack web application built using FastAPI for backend development and HTML with CSS for frontend design. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how modern backend APIs can be integrated with simple frontend pages in a clean and scalable manner. The codebase is designed to be easy to understand while still following real world development practices.
</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<p>
The project follows a modular and organized structure where backend logic and frontend files are clearly separated. Backend files handle routing request validation and business logic while frontend templates manage page rendering and user interface. Static CSS files are used for styling and are served efficiently by the application. This separation improves readability and long term maintainability.
</p>

<h2>Backend Features</h2>
<p>
FastAPI is used for building high performance APIs with modern Python support. The project includes CRUD operations proper request and response validation using Pydantic models and structured API responses. Interactive API documentation is automatically generated which allows easy testing of endpoints. Error handling is implemented carefully so that unexpected issues do not crash the application.
</p>

<h2>Frontend Integration</h2>
<p>
HTML is used to create clean and simple user interfaces while CSS is responsible for layout and visual styling. FastAPI template rendering is used to pass backend data to frontend pages. This setup shows how FastAPI can be used not only as an API framework but also as a complete full stack solution.
</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>
Python is used as the primary programming language. FastAPI handles backend logic and API creation. HTML is used for page structure and CSS is used for styling. Uvicorn is used to run the application server.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
This project can be used as a starter template for full stack web applications. Developers can extend backend functionality connect databases and improve frontend design as required. It is suitable for beginners as well as developers looking for a clean reference project.
